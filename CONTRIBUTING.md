# Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Strategy
We follow a structured branch workflow:

- **`develop`** → Main branch for integrating PRs.
- **`staging`** → Testing branch, merged from `develop`.
- **`main`** → Stable production branch, merged from `staging`.

Please submit PRs to `develop`, not `main`.

Thank you for your contributions!
